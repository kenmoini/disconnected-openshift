# Deploy JFrog Artifactory via Podman

> If you can deploy Harbor, that's the easier/best option.  JFrog has a bug that cannot enumerate over long lists of tags (like the 11k+ release tags) and will fail when used with the OpenShift Update Service.

In case you need to spin up a quick container image registry, JFrog OSS is a great option.
