# Extras

Just some various extra goodies to help with different little tasks to avoid any road bumps.

- [NGINX Container](./nginx-container/) - Just need to run a simple NGINX container on a Linux system?  Easy.
- [HTTP Mirror](./http-mirror/) - Need to automatically download files and then serve them via HTTP?
